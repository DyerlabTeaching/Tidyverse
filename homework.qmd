This activity will be a first step for you to develop the skills necessary for to perform these activities. To date, we've used some example data from the [Rice Rivers Center](https://ricerivers.vcu.edu) but in this exercise, I want you to go out and try to find a public data set related to something you are interested in (e.g., something related to your own work).

## Tasks

You are going to produce a document that summarizes an external data set. This data set is one that you will have to go find on your own. The document will have the following components (in addition to the normal required materials for any online homework). This work will be evaluated using the *Markdown Document Grading Rubric* on the Canvas site.

Your document should have the following components:

1. Create a folder in your course RStudio Project folder.  Call this one `TidyVerse`.\
2. Create a new Quarto document in this folder and name it TidyverseHomeWork.qmd. \
3. Find your data set and either:\
    a) Upload it to GoogleDocs and put its published CSV url in here, or\
    b) Download the data set and put it in the same directory as your Quarto document.\
4. Create the skeleton of a reserach document usiung headers to include:\
    a) `Abstract`: A brief summary of the data set you have found and its properties.\
    c) `Methods`: A description of how you loaded in and configured the data.\
    d) `Results`: A summary of the data to include some tabular output using the `knitr` and `kableExtra` libraries to create tables suitable for publication quality.  For the data tables, summarize by including the name of the variable, its minimimum, mean, and maximum values.\
5. Render this document and submit it on Canvas.
