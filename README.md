## Impetus

The tidyverse is a constellation of libraries that have been created to make data maniupulation easier and your research generaly more reliable and repeatable. The `tidy` movement has really gone a long way in creating tools that make data analysis much more enjoyable and accessable.

## Module Learning Objectives

### Apply Tidyverse verbs to manipulate and transform data frames

> Learners will use core functions (select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by) with the pipe operator to clean, restructure, and summarize datasets.

**Bloom’s Levels:** Apply, Analyze

**Reinforces:** Developing fluency with the “grammar of data manipulation,” seeing data wrangling as a logical, repeatable process rather than ad-hoc coding.

**Notes:** Emphasizes building comfort with select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, and group_by as core building blocks in future workflows.

### Create reproducible workflows that yield analysis-ready outputs 

> Learners will chain Tidyverse operations into readable, reproducible workflows that produce tabular and graphical summaries suitable for interpretation in data analyses.

**Bloom’s Levels:** Apply, Create

**Reinforces:** Reproducibility and clarity in coding, aligning data work with transparent scientific practice.

**Notes:** Highlights chaining operations with pipes to create workflows that are readable, testable, and directly useful for data analyses.

## Content

Content for this topic include the following resources.

-   The [slides](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Tidyverse/slides.html) on basic tidyverse use.
-   A larger [narrative](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Tidyverse/narrative.html) going into more depth on the specifics of the topic.
-   The data set we will use for this is the Rice Rivers Center data set (from 2014). You can see it here as its normal [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mk1YGH9LqjF7drJE-td1G_JkdADOU0eMlrP01WFBT8s/edit?usp=sharing) or as a [CSV](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mk1YGH9LqjF7drJE-td1G_JkdADOU0eMlrP01WFBT8s/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv) file.
-   A [cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/main/data-transformation.pdf) going over the basic analysis verb functions from `dplyr`.

## Assessments

This activity has both in-class and homework activities.

-   An [in class](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Tidyverse/in-class.html) document that we will work through in person to learn about tabular output.
-   A take-heme [homework](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Tidyverse/homework.html) document where you'll be gathering your own data and providing a prublished summary of it, following the published rubric.
