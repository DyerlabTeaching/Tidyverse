## Impetus

The tidyverse is a constellation of libraries that have been created to make data maniupulation easier and your research generaly more reliable and repeatable.  The `tidy` movement has really gone a long way in creating tools that make data analysis much more enjoyable and accessable.

## Module Learning Objectives

This module has the following learning objective.

### Apply and create tidy data workflows

> Learners will use the core Tidyverse “verbs” (e.g., select, filter, mutate, summarize, group_by) to manipulate data frames, and will design reproducible workflows that transform raw datasets into clear, analysis-ready tabular summaries.

  - Bloom’s Levels: *Apply* (use Tidyverse verbs to manipulate data), *Create* (design reproducible workflows, produce summaries).

## Content

Content for this topic include the following resources.

 - The [slides](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Tidyverse/slides.html) on basic tidyverse use.
 - A larger [narrative](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Tidyverse/narrative.html) going into more depth on the specifics of the topic.
 - The data set we will use for this is the Rice Rivers Center data set (from 2014).  You can see it here as its normal [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mk1YGH9LqjF7drJE-td1G_JkdADOU0eMlrP01WFBT8s/edit?usp=sharing) or as a [CSV](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mk1YGH9LqjF7drJE-td1G_JkdADOU0eMlrP01WFBT8s/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv) file.
 - A [cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/main/data-transformation.pdf) going over the basic analysis verb functions from `dplyr`.

## Assessments

This activity has both in-class and homework activities.

- An [in class](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Tidyverse/in-class.html) document that we will work through in person to learn about tabular output.
- A take-heme [homework](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Tidyverse/homework.html) document where you'll be gathering your own data and providing a prublished summary of it, following the [online homework](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/ENVS-543/homework_rubric.html) rubric.
